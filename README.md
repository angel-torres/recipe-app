# RECIPE APP
I've made this project so that I could practice using TypeScript in react. I wanted it to be a simple and to the point. Nothing fancy. I tend to get lost as I start working on projects. Usually this happens because I don't have a well defined goal. Below I will difine my goals so that I can better keep track of the project and it's progress.

I created this project using `npm create react-app project-name --typescript`
    - This creates a boilerplate so that you can get started with typescript right away. React does all of the setup for you.
    - Once youre project is created you'll see that you'll have files with a .ts extension rather than your usual .js.

## GETTING STARTED

1. You can run this project by making sure you `cd` into the `client` directory. 
2. Once there run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies.
3. While still  at the `client` directory, run `npm start` to serve project on `http://localhost:3000`.

## ABOUT
This project is a recipe app. When the user gets to the site they will be prompted to input username. Once they input the username then they are redirected to a mini dashboard. They will be able to see a button to add a new recipe. Once they click the `add new recipe button` they will see a modal with a form where they can add a new recipe. Once they fill everything out they can post a new recipe. Once the recipe is posted they will see the post in a card list in their dashboard. As more recipes get added they will appear in the dashboard. If they click a card a modal will pop up with pre-filled form. They will have the options to update or delete the recipe. 

### MVP 
    1. User can input a new username
    2. User can view dashboard
    3. User can create new recipe
    4. User can update or 
    5. User can delete recipe
