# RECIPE APP
I've made this project so that I could practice using TypeScript in react. I wanted it to be a simple and to the point. Nothing fancy. I tend to get lost as I start working on projects. Usually this happens because I don't have a well defined goal. Below I will difine my goals so that I can better keep track of the project and it's progress.

I created this project using `npm create react-app project-name --typescript`
    - This creates a boilerplate so that you can get started with typescript right away. React does all of the setup for you.
    - Once youre project is created you'll see that you'll have files with a .ts extension rather than your usual .js.

## GETTING STARTED

1. You can run this project by making sure you `cd` into the `client` directory. 
2. Once there run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies.
3. While still  at the `client` directory, run `npm start` to serve project on `http://localhost:3000`.
